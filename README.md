I have conducted some well-known physics experiments,which have been done by famous physicist in the history, at Boğaziçi University's Modern Physics Lab. After each experiment I analyze the experiment using root's built-in function by plotting the data, applying a fit and getting data from it. I here uploaded the code for each experiment which plots those graphs and gives the final results of my experiments on the terminal.
Here are the list of experiments that have been conducted by me:
-Charge to Mass Ratio of the Electron
-Radioactive decay of Radon(220)
-Franck-Hertz Experiment
-Poisson Statistics Experiment
